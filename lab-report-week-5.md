# Lab Report Week 5: Researching Commands

## `less` command

```
-ppattern or --pattern=pattern
    The -p option on the command line is equivalent to specifying +/pattern; that is, it tells less to start at the first occurrence of pattern in the file.
```

For example, `less -p` can be used to find an option for a command in man:

<img src="Lab_5_1.png" alt="drawing" width="500"/>

Another useful example is 

## `find` command

## `grep` command
